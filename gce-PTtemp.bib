abstract = {The ability of several water models to predict the properties of ices is discussed. The emphasis is put on the results for the densities and the coexistence curves between the different ice forms. It is concluded that none of the most commonly used rigid models is satisfactory. A new model specifically designed to cope with solid-phase properties is proposed. The parameters have been obtained by fitting the equation of state and selected points of the melting lines and of the coexistence lines involving different ice forms. The phase diagram is then calculated for the new potential. The predicted melting temperature of hexagonal ice (Ih) at 1 bar is 272.2 K. This excellent value does not imply a deterioration of the rest of the properties. In fact, the predictions for both the densities and the coexistence curves are better than for TIP4P, which previously yielded the best estimations of the ice properties.},

abstract = {A potential model intended to be a general purpose model for the condensed phases of water is presented. TIP4P/2005 is a rigid four site model which consists of three fixed point charges and one Lennard-Jones center. The parametrization has been based on a fit of the temperature of maximum density (indirectly estimated from the melting point of hexagonal ice), the stability of several ice polymorphs and other commonly used target quantities. The calculated properties include a variety of thermodynamic properties of the liquid and solid phases, the phase diagram involving condensed phases, properties at melting and vaporization, dielectric constant, pair distribution function, and self-diffusion coefficient. These properties cover a temperature range from 123 to 573 K and pressures up to 40 000 bar. The model gives an impressive performance for this variety of properties and thermodynamic conditions. For example, it gives excellent predictions for the densities at 1 bar with a maximum density at 278 K and an averaged difference with experiment of 7×10−4 g/cm3.},

abstract = {An exhaustive study by molecular dynamics has been performed to analyze the factors that enhance the precision of the technique of direct coexistence for a system of ice and liquid water. The factors analyzed are the stochastic nature of the method, the finite size effects, and the influence of the initial ice configuration used. The results obtained show that the precision of estimates obtained through the technique of direct coexistence is markedly affected by the effects of finite size, requiring systems with a large number of molecules to reduce the error bar of the melting point. This increase in size causes an increase in the simulation time, but the estimate of the melting point with a great accuracy is important, for example, in studies on the ice surface. We also verified that the choice of the initial ice Ih configuration with different proton arrangements does not significantly affect the estimate of the melting point. Importantly this study leads us to estimate the melting point at ambient pressure of two of the most popular models of water, TIP4P/2005 and TIP4P/Ice, with the greatest precision to date.},

abstract = {Direct coexistence simulations between the fluid and solid phases are performed for several ices. For ices Ih and VII it has already been shown that the methodology is successful and the melting point is in agreement with that obtained from free energy calculations. In this work the methodology is applied to ices II, III, V, and VI. The lengths of the direct coexistence runs for the high pressure polymorphs are not too long and last less than 20 ns for all ices except for ice II where longer runs (of about 150 ns) are needed. For ices II, V, and VI the results obtained are completely consistent with those obtained from free energy calculations. However, for ice III it is found that the melting point from direct coexistence simulations is higher than that obtained from free energy calculations, the difference being greater than the statistical error. Since ice III presents partial proton orientational disorder, the departure is attributed to differences in the partial proton order in the water model with respect to that found in the experiment. The phase diagram of the TIP4P/2005 model is recalculated using the melting points obtained from direct coexistence simulations. The new phase diagram is similar to the previous one except for the coexistence lines where ice III is involved. The range of stability of ice III on the p-T plot of the phase diagram increases significantly. It is seen that the model qualitatively describes the phase diagram of water. In this work it is shown that the complete phase diagram of water including ices Ih, II, III, V, VI, VII, and the fluid phase can be obtained from direct coexistence simulations without the need of free energy calculations.},

Comparisons are made with experimental thermodynamic and structural data including the recent neutron diffraction results of Thiessen and Narten. The computed densities and potential energies are in reasonable accord with experiment except for the original BF model, which yields an 18\% overestimate of the density and poor structural results. The TIPS2 and TIP4P potentials yield oxygen–oxygen partial structure functions in good agreement with the neutron diffraction results. The accord with the experimental OH and HH partial structure functions is poorer; however, the computed results for these functions are similar for all the potential functions. Consequently, the discrepancy may be due to the correction terms needed in processing the neutron data or to an effect uniformly neglected in the computations. Comparisons are also made for self‐diffusion coefficients obtained from molecular dynamics simulations. Overall, the SPC, ST2, TIPS2, and TIP4P models give reasonable structural and thermodynamic descriptions of liquid water and they should be useful in simulations of aqueous solutions. The simplicity of the SPC, TIPS2, and TIP4P functions is also attractive from a computational standpoint.},

The disordering of the surface seen in the calculations can be explained in terms of the disruption of the hydrogen bonding network at the surface. At T = 210 K and lower the surface remains solid-like, as evidenced by non-zero order parameters and no calculable self-diffusion, although the reorientational correlation time (ca. 100 ps) is closer to that of the liquid than that of bulk ice. On the other hand, at T = 230 K (-43°C) and higher the surface is liquid-like, as shown by low order parameters and a high translational and rotational mobility of the molecules. At all temperatures, there is an orientational preference for the water molecule pointing its protons down, which is in agreement with experiment. The polarisation of the surface increases with increasing temperature. For the transition layer, the calculated reorientational correlation times are in rough agreement with NMR experiments, but for T ≥ 230 K the calculated self-diffusion coefficients are much higher than the values obtained in NMR experiments. © 1992.},

abstract = {Upon cooling, water freezes to ice. This familiar phase transition occurs widely in nature, yet unlike the freezing of simple liquids, it has never been successfully simulated on a computer. The difficulty lies with the fact that hydrogen bonding between individual water molecules yields a disordered three-dimensional hydrogen-bond network whose rugged and complex global potential energy surface permits a large number of possible network configurations. As a result, it is very challenging to reproduce the freezing of 'real' water into a solid with a unique crystalline structure. For systems with a limited number of possible disordered hydrogen-bond network structures, such as confined water, it is relatively easy to locate a pathway from a liquid state to a crystalline structure. For pure and spatially unconfined water, however, molecular dynamics simulations of freezing are severely hampered by the large number of possible network configurations that exist. Here we present a molecular dynamics trajectory that captures the molecular processes involved in the freezing of pure water. We find that ice nucleation occurs once a sufficient number of relatively long-lived hydrogen bonds develop spontaneously at the same location to form a fairly compact initial nucleus. The initial nucleus then slowly changes shape and size until it reaches a stage that allows rapid expansion, resulting in crystallization of the entire system.},

abstract = {Water and silicon are chemically dissimilar substances with common physical properties. Their liquids display a temperature of maximum density, increased diffusivity on compression, and they form tetrahedral crystals and tetrahedral amorphous phases. The common feature to water, silicon, and carbon is the formation of tetrahedrally coordinated units. We exploit these similarities to develop a coarse-grained model of water (mW) that is essentially an atom with tetrahedrality intermediate between carbon and silicon. mW mimics the hydrogen-bonded structure of water through the introduction of a nonbond angular dependent term that encourages tetrahedral configurations. The model departs from the prevailing paradigm in water modeling: the use of long-ranged forces (electrostatics) to produce short-ranged (hydrogen-bonded) structure. mW has only short-range interactions yet it reproduces the energetics, density and structure of liquid water, and its anomalies and phase transitions with comparable or better accuracy than the most popular atomistic models of water, at less than 1\% of the computational cost. We conclude that it is not the nature of the interactions but the connectivity of the molecules that determines the structural and thermodynamic behavior of water. The speedup in computing time provided by mW makes it particularly useful for the study of slow processes in deeply supercooled water, the mechanism of ice nucleation, wetting-drying transitions, and as a realistic water model for coarse-grained simulations of biomolecules and complex materials.},

abstract = {One of water's unsolved puzzles is the question of what determines the lowest temperature to which it can be cooled before freezing to ice. The supercooled liquid has been probed experimentally to near the homogeneous nucleation temperature, T(H) ≈ 232 K, yet the mechanism of ice crystallization-including the size and structure of critical nuclei-has not yet been resolved. The heat capacity and compressibility of liquid water anomalously increase on moving into the supercooled region, according to power laws that would diverge (that is, approach infinity) at \~{}225 K (refs 1, 2), so there may be a link between water's thermodynamic anomalies and the crystallization rate of ice. But probing this link is challenging because fast crystallization prevents experimental studies of the liquid below T(H). And although atomistic studies have captured water crystallization, high computational costs have so far prevented an assessment of the rates and mechanism involved. Here we report coarse-grained molecular simulations with the mW water model in the supercooled regime around T(H) which reveal that a sharp increase in the fraction of four-coordinated molecules in supercooled liquid water explains its anomalous thermodynamics and also controls the rate and mechanisms of ice formation. The results of the simulations and classical nucleation theory using experimental data suggest that the crystallization rate of water reaches a maximum around 225 K, below which ice nuclei form faster than liquid water can equilibrate. This implies a lower limit of metastability of liquid water just below T(H) and well above its glass transition temperature, 136 K. By establishing a relationship between the structural transformation in liquid water and its anomalous thermodynamics and crystallization rate, our findings also provide mechanistic insight into the observed dependence of homogeneous ice nucleation rates on the thermodynamics of water.},

abstract = {Among all of the freezing transitions, that of water into ice is probably the most relevant to biology, physics, geology, or atmospheric science. In this work, we investigate homogeneous ice nucleation by means of computer simulations. We evaluate the size of the critical cluster and the nucleation rate for temperatures ranging between 15 and 35 K below melting. We use the TIP4P/2005 and the TIP4P/ice water models. Both give similar results when compared at the same temperature difference with the model's melting temperature. The size of the critical cluster varies from ∼8000 molecules (radius = 4 nm) at 15 K below melting to ∼600 molecules (radius = 1.7 nm) at 35 K below melting. We use Classical Nucleation Theory (CNT) to estimate the ice-water interfacial free energy and the nucleation free-energy barrier. We obtain an interfacial free energy of 29(3) mN/m from an extrapolation of our results to the melting temperature. This value is in good agreement both with experimental measurements and with previous estimates from computer simulations of TIP4P-like models. Moreover, we obtain estimates of the nucleation rate from simulations of the critical cluster at the barrier top. The values we get for both models agree within statistical error with experimental measurements. At temperatures higher than 20 K below melting, we get nucleation rates slower than the appearance of a critical cluster in all water of the hydrosphere during the age of the universe. Therefore, our simulations predict that water freezing above this temperature must necessarily be heterogeneous.},

@article{Tanaka2003,
abstract = {Generally, the entropy of the supercooled liquid decreases more rapidly than that of the crystal. Thus, the former, if we extrapolate it smoothly below the glass-transition temperature T(g), becomes equal to the latter at the so-called Kauzmann temperature T(K). Further extrapolation below T(K) leads to the unphysical situation that the entropy of disordered liquid is lower than the ordered crystal, which results in the violation of the third law of thermodynamics. This is known as the "Kauzmann paradox" which has been the key problem of liquid-glass transition for a long time. Here we propose a simple resolution of the Kauzmann paradox by answering a fundamental question of how deeply we can supercool a liquid. We argue that the lower metastable limit T(LML), below which a liquid should crystallize before its structural relaxation, is located above the Kauzmann temperature T(K). Thus, the entropy crisis at T(K) is naturally avoided by crystallization. We suggest that it is dynamic heterogeneity that destabilizes a deeply supercooled "equilibrium" liquid state as well as a glassy state against crystallization. This may have a significant implication on the stability of a glassy state, which is of industrial importance in relation to the storage of glassy material.},

abstract = {We consider the calculation of the surface tension from simulations of several models of water, such as the traditional TIP3P, SPC, SPC/E, and TIP4P models, and the new generation of TIP4P-like models including the TIP4P/Ew, TIP4P/Ice, and TIP4P/2005. We employ a thermodynamic route proposed by Gloor et al. [J. Chem. Phys. 123, 134703 (2005)] to determine the surface tension that involves the estimate of the change in free energy associated with a small change in the interfacial area at constant volume. The values of the surface tension computed from this test-area method are found to be fully consistent with those obtained from the standard mechanical route, which is based on the evaluation of the components of the pressure tensor. We find that most models do not reproduce quantitatively the experimental values of the surface tension of water. The best description of the surface tension is given by those models that provide a better description of the vapor-liquid coexistence curve. The values of the surface tension for the SPC/E and TIP4P/Ew models are found to be in reasonably good agreement with the experimental values. From the present investigation, we conclude that the TIP4P/2005 model is able to accurately describe the surface tension of water over the whole range of temperatures from the triple point to the critical temperature. We also conclude that the test area is an appropriate methodological choice for the calculation of the surface tension not only for simple fluids, but also for complex molecular polar fluids, as is the case of water.},

abstract = {The melting temperature of ice I(h) for several commonly used models of water (SPC, SPC/E,TIP3P,TIP4P, TIP4P/Ew, and TIP5P) is obtained from computer simulations at p = 1 bar. Since the melting temperature of ice I(h) for the TIP4P model is now known [E. Sanz, C. Vega, J. L. F. Abascal, and L. G. MacDowell, Phys. Rev. Lett. 92, 255701 (2004)], it is possible to use the Gibbs-Duhem methodology [D. Kofke, J. Chem. Phys. 98, 4149 (1993)] to evaluate the melting temperature of ice I(h) for other potential models of water. We have found that the melting temperatures of ice I(h) for SPC, SPC/E, TIP3P, TIP4P, TIP4P/Ew, and TIP5P models are T = 190 K, 215 K, 146 K, 232 K, 245 K, and 274 K, respectively. The relative stability of ice I(h) with respect to ice II for these models has also been considered. It turns out that for SPC, SPC/E, TIP3P, and TIP5P the stable phase at the normal melting point is ice II (so that ice I(h) is not a thermodynamically stable phase for these models). For TIP4P and TIP4P/Ew, ice I(h) is the stable solid phase at the standard melting point. The location of the negative charge along the H-O-H bisector appears as a critical factor in the determination of the relative stability between the I(h) and II ice forms. The methodology proposed in this paper can be used to investigate the effect upon a coexistence line due to a change in the potential parameters.},

@article{Vega2011,
abstract = {Over the last forty years many computer simulations of water have been performed using rigid non-polarizable models. Since these models describe water interactions in an approximate way it is evident that they cannot reproduce all of the properties of water. By now many properties for these kinds of models have been determined and it seems useful to compile some of these results and provide a critical view of the successes and failures. In this paper a test is proposed in which 17 properties of water, from the vapour and liquid to the solid phases, are taken into account to evaluate the performance of a water model. A certain number of points between zero (bad agreement) and ten (good agreement) are given for the predictions of each model and property. We applied the test to five rigid non-polarizable models, TIP3P, TIP5P, TIP4P, SPC/E and TIP4P/2005, obtaining an average score of 2.7, 3.7, 4.7, 5.1, and 7.2 respectively. Thus although no model reproduces all properties, some models perform better than others. It is clear that there are limitations for rigid non-polarizable models. Neglecting polarizability prevents an accurate description of virial coefficients, vapour pressures, critical pressure and dielectric constant. Neglecting nuclear quantum effects prevents an accurate description of the structure, the properties of water below 120 K and the heat capacity. It is likely that for rigid non-polarizable models it may not be possible to increase the score in the test proposed here beyond 7.6. To get closer to experiment, incorporating polarization and nuclear quantum effects is absolutely required even though a substantial increase in computer time should be expected. The test proposed here, being quantitative and selecting properties from all phases of water can be useful in the future to identify progress in the modelling of water.},

We report the calculation of the melting point of ice I(h) at 1 bar for seven water models: SPC/E, TIP4P, TIP4P-Ew, TIP4P/ice, TIP4P/2005, TIP5P, and TIP5P-E. The results for the melting temperature from the direct coexistence simulations of this work are in agreement (within the statistical uncertainty) with those obtained previously by us from free energy calculations.
